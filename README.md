I am excited to present my Python solutions for Advent of Code 2023. Below, you'll find a utility function that dynamically imports and executes solutions for various days and parts based on user input. 

# How-to use Replit

Simply click 'Run,' input your preferred day and part number (1 or 2). The function will then prompt whether you possess an input file (located in the 'inputs' directory as '.txt' files by default). Opting for 'y' (yes) will reveal both the OUTPUT and ANSWER. Alternatively, if you prefer to test the code, select 'n' (no) and provide your custom input.

Feel free to explore and run the existing code, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. 

## Happy coding! ðŸŽ„ And may your Advent of Code journey be filled with fun challenges and rewarding solutions!
